### Project Summary: Corp Finder

#### Project Overview
Corp Finder is a full-stack web application designed as a company directory platform. It allows users to browse, search, and filter a list of companies by name, location, and industry. The app features a responsive UI with a collapsible sidebar, dark mode toggle, routing between Home and About pages, and a fixed footer. The backend provides RESTful APIs for data retrieval and seeding. The frontend is built with React and Material-UI (MUI), while the backend uses Express.js and MongoDB for data storage. The app emphasizes performance, responsiveness, and user experience with features like pagination, real-time filters, and animations (though animations were removed for optimization).

The project structure includes:
- **Frontend**: Located in `demo-project/`, a React app with components for layout, data display, and navigation.
- **Backend**: Located in `demo-backend/`, an Express server handling API requests and database interactions.
- **Database**: MongoDB running locally via Docker, storing company data.
- **Styling**: MUI theme with custom colors (sea blue primary, sea green secondary), Poppins font, and adaptive light/dark modes.
- **Deployment Readiness**: Frontend can be built for static hosting; backend for server deployment.

#### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) using React Router for navigation. It fetches data from the backend via Axios and manages state locally. Key libraries: React (UI), MUI (components/styling), Axios (HTTP requests), React Router (routing).

##### Components and Their Functions
1. **App.js** (Main Layout Component)
   - **Purpose**: Root component managing global state, theme, layout, and routing. Acts as the app shell.
   - **Key Features**:
     - ThemeProvider: Applies MUI theme with light/dark mode support, persisted in localStorage.
     - AppBar: Fixed top navigation bar with menu icon (for mobile drawer), logo image (corp_finder.PNG), and responsive design.
     - Drawer: Collapsible left sidebar (permanent on desktop, temporary on mobile) with navigation links (Home, About, Settings). Includes logo text ("CF" or "Corp Finder") and collapse toggle. Height reduced to avoid footer overlap.
     - Menu: Dropdown for Settings submenu (dark mode toggle).
     - Main Content Area: Flex-grow container for routed pages, with padding and toolbar spacer.
     - Footer: Fixed bottom bar with copyright text, full-width, high z-index to overlay sidebar.
   - **State Management**: useState for drawer open/collapse, dark mode. useEffect for localStorage persistence.
   - **Connections**: Routes to Home and About components. Fetches no data directly but provides theme context.

2. **Home.js** (Company Listings Page)
   - **Purpose**: Displays a table of companies with search, filters, and pagination. Core functionality for browsing the directory.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Table: MUI Table with sticky header, sortable columns (Name, Location, Industry), pagination (10 rows/page), and loading states.
     - Filters: TextField for name search, Select dropdowns for location and industry (populated from API). Real-time filtering via API calls.
     - API Integration: Fetches companies with query params (page, limit, name, location, industry). Handles loading/errors.
     - Responsive: Table scrolls on mobile; filters stack vertically.
   - **State Management**: useState for data, filters, pagination, loading. useEffect for initial load and filter changes.
   - **Connections**: Calls backend `/api/companies` (GET) for data and `/api/filters` for dropdown options. Updates on filter changes.

3. **About.js** (About Page)
   - **Purpose**: Static informational page describing the company, founders, motto, and services.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Grid Layout: Responsive grid (2 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile) with sections for Founders, Motto, and Services.
     - Typography: Headings and body text, styled with primary color.
     - No Cards: Text displayed directly without Paper wrappers for a flat design.
   - **State Management**: None (static content).
   - **Connections**: No API calls; standalone page routed from App.js.

##### How Frontend Components Connect
- **App.js** wraps everything in ThemeProvider and CssBaseline, providing theme and routing. It renders AppBar, Drawer, and routes to Home/About.
- **Home.js** is routed at "/" and fetches data independently via Axios.
- **About.js** is routed at "/about" with no external dependencies.
- Global State: Dark mode in App.js affects all components via theme. No Redux; local state suffices.
- Responsiveness: MUI's useMediaQuery in App.js toggles drawer variant.
- Theming: Custom overrides for TextField/Select adapt to dark mode.

#### Backend Architecture
The backend is a Node.js server using Express for REST APIs, Mongoose for MongoDB interaction, and Faker for data seeding. It runs on port 3000 (default), with CORS enabled for frontend requests.

##### Components and Their Functions
1. **server.js** (Main Server File)
   - **Purpose**: Express app serving APIs for company data and filters.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Routes:
       - GET `/api/companies`: Fetches paginated/filtered companies (query params: page, limit, name, location, industry). Returns JSON with data and total count.
       - GET `/api/filters`: Aggregates unique locations and industries from DB for dropdowns.
     - Middleware: CORS for cross-origin, JSON parsing.
     - Database: Mongoose connects to local MongoDB ("demo" DB, "companies" collection).
     - Error Handling: Basic try/catch for DB queries.
   - **Connections**: Directly queries MongoDB. No auth; open APIs.

2. **insertData.js** (Data Seeding Script)
   - **Purpose**: Generates and inserts fake company data into MongoDB.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Uses Faker.js for names (company.name), locations (location.city), and industries (random from one-word list: Health, Tech, etc.).
     - Inserts 100 records, clearing existing data first.
     - Schema: Simple Mongoose model with name, location, industry (strings).
   - **Connections**: Runs once to seed DB; not part of runtime server.

##### How Backend Components Connect
- **server.js** is the runtime server, handling requests and DB interactions.
- **insertData.js** is a one-time script for setup.
- Database: MongoDB stores data; Mongoose provides ODM for queries.

#### Full-Stack Connections
- **Frontend to Backend**: Axios in Home.js calls `http://localhost:3000/api/companies` and `/api/filters`. Backend responds with JSON; frontend updates UI.
- **Data Flow**: User interacts with filters → Home.js builds query → Axios GET → Backend queries MongoDB → Returns data → Home.js renders table.
- **Deployment**: Frontend builds to static files (served via Nginx/Vercel). Backend deploys to Heroku/AWS. MongoDB via Atlas or local.
- **Security/Performance**: No auth; basic CORS. Pagination limits data load. Dark mode via localStorage.

#### Technologies and Dependencies
- **Frontend**: React 18, MUI 5, Axios, React Router, Framer Motion (removed).
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Mongoose, Faker.js.
- **Database**: MongoDB.
- **Dev Tools**: Create-React-App, npm scripts (start, build).
